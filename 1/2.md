## Arrays

Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location. It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.

### Advantages

1. Code Optimization: It makes the code optimized, we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently.

2. Random access: We can get any data located at an index position.

### Disadvantages

1. Size Limit: We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array. It doesn't grow its size at runtime. To solve this problem, collection framework is used in Java which grows automatically.

## Declaring an array in Java

There are 3 ways to declare an array in Java:
```Java
dataType[] arr; 
dataType []arr;  
dataType arr[];  
```

While instantiation is performed in 2 ways:

```Java
datatype arr[] = new datatype[size];
datatype arr = {elements, separated, by comma}
```

## Accessing array elements

To access an element at a certain index, you follow this syntax(remember, array indices start at 0).

```Java
arr[indexOfElement];
arr[5]; // Access 6th element of the array
arr[0]; // Access 1st element of the array
```
