## Primitives

Java has eight built-in data types, referred to as the Java primitive types. These eight data types represent the building blocks for Java objects, because all Java objects are just a complex collection of these primitive data types.

Here is a table containing all Java primitive types:

|Keyword |Type | Example|
|---|---|---|
|boolean | true or false | true
|byte | 8-bit integral value | 123
|short | 16-bit integral value | 123
|int | 32-bit integral value |123
|long | 64-bit integral value |123
|float | 32-bit floating-point value |123.45f
|double | 64-bit floating-point value |123.4567
|char | 16-bit Unicode value | 'a'

## Literals

<b>Literal</b>: Any constant value which can be assigned to the variable is called literal/constant. 

In simple words, Literals in Java is a synthetic representation of boolean, numeric, character, or string data. It is a medium of expressing particular values in the program, such as an integer variable named ‘’/count is assigned an integer value in the following statement.

``` Java
// Here 100 is a constant/literal.
int x = 100; 
```

Character literal example:

``` Java
// Here 'a' is a character literal
char x = 'a';
```

Floating point literals come in two types, double literals and float literals

``` Java
// Here the float literal is 1.34f:
float a = 1.34f;
// Here the double literal is 1.11:
double b = 1.11;
```

String literals are enclosed in double quotation marks and return a String object, here is an example:

``` Java
// Here the string literal is "This is a strig literal"
String str = "This is a string literal";
```
