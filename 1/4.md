# Arithmetic operators 
Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations.
|Operator| Name| Description| Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|+ |	Addition 	|Adds together two values |	x + y 	
|- |	Subtraction |	Subtracts one value from another |	x - y 	
|* |	Multiplication| 	Multiplies two values |	x * y 	
|/ |	Division 	|Divides one value by another |	x / y 	
|% |	Modulus |	Returns the division remainder |	x % y 	
|++ |Increment |	Increases the value of a variable by 1 |	++x 	
|-- 	|Decrement |	Decreases the value of a variable by 1 |	--x

## Division rules

1. You cannot divide by 0
2. Dividing 2 integers will result in any decimal values being dropped, and the keeping of only the integer part of the result, so at least one of the operands should be a float/double for the result to be a floating point number
``` Java
    System.out.pritln(3 / 2);
    //Result is 1
    System.out.println(3.0 / 2);
    //Result is 1.5
    System.out.pritln(3 / 2.0);
    //Result is 1.5
```
