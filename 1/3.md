## Declarations

The concept of declaration includes informing the compiler about properties of the variable such as its name, type of value it holds and the initial value if any it takes. Here is an example of a declaration:

```Java
//int is the type of the variable, "a" is the name/identifier
int a;
```

You can declare a variable without defining/assigning it a value, but using an undeclared value can cause a runtime exception.

## Identifiers

Identifiers in Java are symbolic names used for identification. They can be a class name, variable name, method name, package name, constant name, and more. However, In Java, There are some reserved words that can not be used as an identifier. Let's identify the identifiers in the image below:

From the above example, we have the following Java identifiers:

1. HelloJava (Class name)
2. main (main method)
3. String (Predefined Class name)
4. args (String variables)
5. System (Predefined class)
6. out (Variable name)
7. println (method)

### Rules for Identifiers in Java

There are some rules and conventions for declaring the identifiers in Java. If the identifiers are not properly declared, we may get a compile-time error. Following are some rules and conventions for declaring identifiers:

1. A valid identifier must have characters [A-Z] or [a-z] or numbers [0-9], and underscore(_) or a dollar sign ($). for example, @javatpoint is not a valid identifier because it contains a special character which is @.
2. There should not be any space in an identifier. For example, java tpoint is an invalid identifier.
3. An identifier should not contain a number at the starting. For example, 123javatpoint is an invalid identifier.
4. An identifier should be of length 4-15 letters only. However, there is no limit on its length. But, it is good to follow the standard conventions.
5. We can't use the Java reserved keywords as an identifier such as int, float, double, char, etc. For example, int double is an invalid identifier in Java.
6. An identifier should not be any query language keywords such as `SELECT`, `FROM`, `COUNT`, `DELETE`, etc.

### Reserved keywords

Java Reserved Keywords

Java reserved keywords are predefined words, which are reserved for any functionality or meaning. We can not use these keywords as our identifier names, such as class name or method name. These keywords are used by the syntax of Java for some functionality. If we use a reserved word as our variable name, it will throw an error.

In Java, every reserved word has a unique meaning and functionality.

Consider the below syntax: 
```Java
double marks;  
```

in the above statement, double is a reserved word while marks is a valid identifier.

```Java
double int; //????
            // int is a reserved keyword, cannot be a valid identifier
```

Here is a table of reserved keywords in Java
|||||
|---|---|---|---|---|
|abstract |continue |for |protected |transient
|Assert |Default |Goto |public |Try
|Boolean |Do |If |Static |throws
|break |double |implements |strictfp |Package
|byte |else |import |super |Private
|case |enum |Interface |Short |switch
|Catch |Extends |instanceof |return |void
|Char |Final |Int |synchronized |volatile
|class |finally |long |throw |Date
|const |float |Native |This |while

Although the `const` and `goto` are not part of the Java language, they are also considered keywords.

## Definition

Comes after declaration, here a value is assigned to the variable that is declared. We have out int "a" above that is undefined, let us define it below:

```Java
//A was defined, now it holds the integer 2.
a = 2;
```
