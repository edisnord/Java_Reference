## Declarations

The concept of declaration includes informing the compiler about properties of the variable such as its name, type of value it holds and the initial value if any it takes. Here is an example of a declaration:

```Java
//int is the type of the variable, "a" is the name/identifier
int a;
```

You can declare a variable without defining/assigning it a value, but using an undeclared value can cause a runtime exception.

## Definition

Comes after declaration, here a value is assigned to the variable that is declared. We have out int "a" above that is undefined, let us define it below:

```Java
//A was defined, now it holds the integer 2.
a = 2;
```
